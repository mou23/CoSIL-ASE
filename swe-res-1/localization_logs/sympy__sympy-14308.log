2026-01-13 20:45:16,989 - INFO - Based on the bug report regarding the pretty printing of vectors and the mention of a baseline issue, the following files are likely to be involved in the functionality related to printing and formatting of vector expressions:

1. `sympy/printing/pretty.py` - This file is likely responsible for the pretty printing functionality.
2. `sympy/printing/printer.py` - This file may contain the core printing logic that could affect how expressions are formatted.
3. `sympy/vector/vector.py` - This file likely defines the vector class and its representation, which could influence how vectors are printed.
4. `sympy/vector/coordsysrect.py` - This file may handle coordinate systems and their representations, which could affect vector printing.
5. `sympy/printing/latex.py` - If the pretty printing involves LaTeX formatting, this file could be relevant.
6. `sympy/printing/preview.py` - This file might be involved in generating previews of printed expressions.
7. `sympy/printing/str.py` - This file could handle string representations of objects, which may include vectors.
8. `sympy/printing/ccode.py` - If there are issues with C code generation for vectors, this file might be relevant.
9. `sympy/printing/rcode.py` - Similar to `ccode.py`, this file could be involved if R code generation is affected.
10. `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` - If there are issues with Mathematica output, this file could also be relevant.

Now, I will list the top-10 most likely culprit files based on the reasoning above:
