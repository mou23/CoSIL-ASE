This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file("config.toml", tomllib.load)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open(\'foo.toml\', \'rb\')`\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does\r\nwith open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, "config.toml"), "rb") as file:\r\n    app.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file("config.toml", tomllib.load, mode="b")\r\n```\r\n\n\n\n###\n\n### Candidate Files ###\ndocs/\n    conf.py\nexamples/\n    tutorial/\n        flaskr/\n            __init__.py\n            blog.py\n            db.py\n            auth.py\n    celery/\n        make_celery.py\n        src/\n            task_app/\n                __init__.py\n                views.py\n                tasks.py\n    javascript/\n        js_example/\n            __init__.py\n            views.py\nsrc/\n    flask/\n        app.py\n        globals.py\n        signals.py\n        debughelpers.py\n        cli.py\n        __init__.py\n        scaffold.py\n        logging.py\n        helpers.py\n        views.py\n        config.py\n        templating.py\n        typing.py\n        wrappers.py\n        blueprints.py\n        __main__.py\n        sessions.py\n        ctx.py\n        json/\n            __init__.py\n            provider.py\n            tag.py\n\n###\n```\n\n\nLet\'s locate the faulty file step by step using reasoning. \nIn order to locate accurately, you can pre-select 7 files, then check them through function calls, and finally confirm 5 file names.\n\n\nBased on the available information, reconfirm and provide complete name of the top-10 most likely culprit files for the bug. \nSince your answer will be processed automatically, please give your answer in the format as follows.\nThe returned files should be separated by new lines ordered by most to least important and wrapped with ```.\n```\nfile1.py\nfile2.py\nfile3.py\nfile4.py\nfile5.py\nfile6.py\nfile7.py\nfile8.py\nfile9.py\nfile10.py\n```\nReplace the \'file1.py\' with the actual file path.\nFor example, \n```\nsklearn/linear_model/__init__.py\nsklearn/base.py\n```\n\n'}]

2026-01-13 20:26:54,177 - INFO - To address the bug report, we need to focus on the `flask.Config.from_file()` method, which is likely implemented in the `src/flask/config.py` file. This file is responsible for configuration handling in Flask, and it is where we would expect to find the implementation that needs modification to support a file mode parameter.

Additionally, we should consider other files that may interact with the configuration system or are related to the application setup. Here are the steps to identify the top-10 most likely culprit files:

1. **Primary File**: The main file to check is `src/flask/config.py`, as it directly relates to the `from_file()` method.
2. **Related Files**: Other files that may be relevant include:
   - `src/flask/app.py`: This file likely initializes the Flask application and may call the configuration methods.
   - `src/flask/__init__.py`: This file is the package initializer and may contain important setup code.
   - `src/flask/helpers.py`: This file may contain utility functions that could be relevant to configuration handling.
   - `src/flask/views.py`: While primarily for routing, it may also interact with the configuration.
   - `src/flask/cli.py`: This file may handle command-line interface commands that could involve configuration loading.
   - `src/flask/scaffold.py`: This file may be involved in setting up the application structure, including configuration.
   - `src/flask/sessions.py`: If sessions are configured through the config, this file may be relevant.
   - `src/flask/ctx.py`: This file manages the application context, which may involve configuration.

Based on this reasoning, the top-10 most likely culprit files are:
