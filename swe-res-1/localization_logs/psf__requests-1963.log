The subsequent 307 should preserve the GET.  However, because\n`Session.resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the _original_\nrequest object, Requests will issue a POST!\n\n\n\n###\n\n### Candidate Files ###\nrequests/\n    setup.py\n    hooks.py\n    status_codes.py\n    __init__.py\n    exceptions.py\n    utils.py\n    structures.py\n    certs.py\n    api.py\n    sessions.py\n    adapters.py\n    compat.py\n    cookies.py\n    auth.py\n    models.py\n    packages/\n        __init__.py\n        chardet/\n            constants.py\n            euckrprober.py\n            sjisprober.py\n            big5freq.py\n            langhebrewmodel.py\n            __init__.py\n            mbcssm.py\n            chardetect.py\n            charsetgroupprober.py\n            cp949prober.py\n            langgreekmodel.py\n            gb2312prober.py\n            euckrfreq.py\n            euctwprober.py\n            sbcsgroupprober.py\n            mbcharsetprober.py\n            eucjpprober.py\n            universaldetector.py\n            euctwfreq.py\n            escsm.py\n            sbcharsetprober.py\n            latin1prober.py\n            langcyrillicmodel.py\n            hebrewprober.py\n            jpcntx.py\n            langthaimodel.py\n            codingstatemachine.py\n            langhungarianmodel.py\n            escprober.py\n            charsetprober.py\n            gb2312freq.py\n            compat.py\n            utf8prober.py\n            mbcsgroupprober.py\n            big5prober.py\n            langbulgarianmodel.py\n            jisfreq.py\n            chardistribution.py\n        urllib3/\n            response.py\n            poolmanager.py\n            __init__.py\n            exceptions.py\n            util.py\n            connectionpool.py\n            fields.py\n            _collections.py\n            connection.py\n            request.py\n            filepost.py\n            packages/\n                __init__.py\n                ordered_dict.py\n                six.py\n                ssl_match_hostname/\n                    __init__.py\n                    _implementation.py\n            contrib/\n                __init__.py\n                ntlmpool.py\n                pyopenssl.py\ndocs/\n    conf.py\n    _themes/\n        flask_theme_support.py\n\n###\n```\n\n\nLet's locate the faulty file step by step using reasoning. \nIn order to locate accurately, you can pre-select 7 files, then check them through function calls, and finally confirm 5 file names.\n\n\nBased on the available information, reconfirm and provide complete name of the top-10 most likely culprit files for the bug. \nSince your answer will be processed automatically, please give your answer in the format as follows.\nThe returned files should be separated by new lines ordered by most to least important and wrapped with ```.\n```\nfile1.py\nfile2.py\nfile3.py\nfile4.py\nfile5.py\nfile6.py\nfile7.py\nfile8.py\nfile9.py\nfile10.py\n```\nReplace the 'file1.py' with the actual file path.\nFor example, \n```\nsklearn/linear_model/__init__.py\nsklearn/base.py\n```\n\n"}]

2026-01-13 20:27:11,060 - INFO - Based on the bug report, the issue seems to be related to how the `Session.resolve_redirects` method handles HTTP requests, particularly in preserving the method type during redirection. The most relevant files to investigate would be those that are likely to contain the `Session` class and its methods, especially `resolve_redirects`.

Here are the steps to identify the top-10 most likely culprit files:

1. **Identify the main file related to session handling**: The `sessions.py` file is likely to contain the `Session` class and its methods, including `resolve_redirects`.

2. **Look for related files that might handle requests**: Files like `api.py`, `adapters.py`, and `hooks.py` may also be relevant as they could interact with the session and request handling.

3. **Consider utility files**: Files like `utils.py` and `exceptions.py` might contain helper functions or error handling that could be relevant to the issue.

4. **Check for status codes**: The `status_codes.py` file could provide context on how different HTTP status codes are handled, which is relevant to the redirection logic.

5. **Include the main `__init__.py`**: This file often initializes the package and may contain important setup code.

Based on this reasoning, the top-10 most likely culprit files are:
