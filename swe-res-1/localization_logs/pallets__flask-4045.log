2026-01-13 20:26:41,477 - INFO - To address the bug report regarding the error raised when a blueprint name contains a dot, we need to focus on files that are likely related to the handling of blueprints in the Flask application. The most relevant files would typically include those that define or manage blueprints, as well as any related configuration or validation logic.

Based on the provided repository structure, the following files are likely candidates:

1. `src/flask/blueprints.py` - This file is likely responsible for the blueprint functionality, including any validation related to blueprint names.
2. `src/flask/app.py` - This file may handle the application setup and could include logic for registering blueprints.
3. `src/flask/views.py` - This file might define views that could be associated with blueprints, potentially including name validation.
4. `src/flask/config.py` - This file may contain configuration settings that could affect how blueprints are processed.
5. `src/flask/scaffold.py` - This file might be involved in creating or managing blueprints.
6. `src/flask/helpers.py` - This file could contain utility functions that assist with blueprint management.
7. `src/flask/signals.py` - This file may handle events related to blueprints, which could include validation logic.
8. `src/flask/templating.py` - This file might be involved in rendering templates that are associated with blueprints.
9. `src/flask/logging.py` - This file could be relevant if there are logging mechanisms that track blueprint registration or errors.
10. `src/flask/cli.py` - This file may include command-line interface commands that interact with blueprints.

Now, let's list these files in the required format:
