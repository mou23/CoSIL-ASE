My understanding was that both should return a unicode object. In essence, I thought "iter_content" was equivalent to "iter_text" when decode_unicode was True. Have I misunderstood something? I can provide an example if needed.\n\nFor reference, I\'m using python 3.5.1 and requests 2.10.0.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n###\n\n### Candidate Files ###\nrequests/\n    setup.py\n    hooks.py\n    status_codes.py\n    __init__.py\n    exceptions.py\n    utils.py\n    structures.py\n    certs.py\n    api.py\n    sessions.py\n    adapters.py\n    compat.py\n    cookies.py\n    auth.py\n    models.py\n    packages/\n        __init__.py\n        chardet/\n            constants.py\n            euckrprober.py\n            sjisprober.py\n            big5freq.py\n            langhebrewmodel.py\n            __init__.py\n            mbcssm.py\n            chardetect.py\n            charsetgroupprober.py\n            cp949prober.py\n            langgreekmodel.py\n            gb2312prober.py\n            euckrfreq.py\n            euctwprober.py\n            sbcsgroupprober.py\n            mbcharsetprober.py\n            eucjpprober.py\n            universaldetector.py\n            euctwfreq.py\n            escsm.py\n            sbcharsetprober.py\n            latin1prober.py\n            langcyrillicmodel.py\n            hebrewprober.py\n            jpcntx.py\n            langthaimodel.py\n            codingstatemachine.py\n            langhungarianmodel.py\n            escprober.py\n            charsetprober.py\n            gb2312freq.py\n            compat.py\n            utf8prober.py\n            mbcsgroupprober.py\n            big5prober.py\n            langbulgarianmodel.py\n            jisfreq.py\n            chardistribution.py\n        urllib3/\n            response.py\n            poolmanager.py\n            __init__.py\n            exceptions.py\n            connectionpool.py\n            fields.py\n            _collections.py\n            connection.py\n            request.py\n            filepost.py\n            util/\n                response.py\n                url.py\n                ssl_.py\n                __init__.py\n                timeout.py\n                connection.py\n                request.py\n                retry.py\n            packages/\n                __init__.py\n                ordered_dict.py\n                six.py\n                backports/\n                    __init__.py\n                    makefile.py\n                ssl_match_hostname/\n                    __init__.py\n                    _implementation.py\n            contrib/\n                appengine.py\n                __init__.py\n                ntlmpool.py\n                socks.py\n                pyopenssl.py\ndocs/\n    conf.py\n    _themes/\n        flask_theme_support.py\n\n###\n```\n\n\nLet\'s locate the faulty file step by step using reasoning. \nIn order to locate accurately, you can pre-select 7 files, then check them through function calls, and finally confirm 5 file names.\n\n\nBased on the available information, reconfirm and provide complete name of the top-10 most likely culprit files for the bug. \nSince your answer will be processed automatically, please give your answer in the format as follows.\nThe returned files should be separated by new lines ordered by most to least important and wrapped with ```.\n```\nfile1.py\nfile2.py\nfile3.py\nfile4.py\nfile5.py\nfile6.py\nfile7.py\nfile8.py\nfile9.py\nfile10.py\n```\nReplace the \'file1.py\' with the actual file path.\nFor example, \n```\nsklearn/linear_model/__init__.py\nsklearn/base.py\n```\n\n'}]

2026-01-13 20:27:56,429 - INFO - To address the bug report regarding the behavior of `iter_content` and `text` in the requests library, we need to focus on files that are likely involved in handling the response content, particularly in relation to encoding and decoding.

### Step 1: Pre-selecting Candidate Files
Based on the bug description, the following files are likely candidates to investigate:

1. `requests/api.py` - This file typically handles the API calls and responses.
2. `requests/sessions.py` - This file manages sessions and may handle response content.
3. `requests/adapters.py` - This file is responsible for the transport layer and may deal with response content.
4. `requests/utils.py` - This file often contains utility functions that may include content handling.
5. `requests/compat.py` - This file may handle compatibility issues, including string handling.
6. `requests/models.py` - This file defines the Response object, which is crucial for understanding how `text` and `iter_content` work.
7. `requests/exceptions.py` - While less likely, it may still be relevant if exceptions are raised during content handling.

Next, we will check the functions related to content handling in these files. The focus will be on how `iter_content` and `text` are defined and used.

### Step 3: Confirming the Top 10 Files
After analyzing the relevant files, we can expand our list to include additional files that may be involved in character encoding and decoding, especially those related to the `chardet` package, which is used for character encoding detection.
