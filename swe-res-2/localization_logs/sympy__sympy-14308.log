2026-01-13 22:54:22,838 - INFO - Based on the bug report regarding the pretty printing of vectors in the SymPy library, the following files are likely to be involved in the issue:

1. **`sympy/printing/pretty.py`** - This file is likely responsible for the pretty printing functionality, which is directly mentioned in the bug report.
2. **`sympy/printing/printer.py`** - This file may contain the core logic for different printing methods, including pretty printing.
3. **`sympy/vector/vector.py`** - Since the issue involves vectors, this file may define the vector objects and their representations.
4. **`sympy/vector/coordsysrect.py`** - This file may handle coordinate systems, which could affect how vectors are printed.
5. **`sympy/printing/latex.py`** - If the pretty printing involves LaTeX formatting, this file could be relevant.
6. **`sympy/printing/preview.py`** - This file might be involved in generating previews of printed output.
7. **`sympy/printing/str.py`** - This file could be responsible for string representations, which may affect pretty printing.
8. **`sympy/printing/ccode.py`** - If there are any C code representations involved, this file might be relevant.
9. **`sympy/printing/rcode.py`** - Similar to ccode.py, this file could be involved if R code representations are relevant.
10. **`sympy/printing/mathematica.py`** - This file may also be involved if Mathematica representations are relevant to the pretty printing.

Based on this reasoning, the top-10 most likely culprit files are:
