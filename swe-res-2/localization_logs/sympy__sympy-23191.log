2026-01-13 23:11:13,546 - INFO - Based on the bug report regarding the display issue with `pretty_print` and the `sympy.vector` object, the following files are likely to be involved in the problem:

1. **`sympy/printing/pretty.py`** - This file is likely responsible for the pretty printing functionality, which is directly related to the issue described.
2. **`sympy/vector/__init__.py`** - This file initializes the vector module and may contain relevant imports or configurations for vector objects.
3. **`sympy/vector/coordsysrect.py`** - This file deals with coordinate systems, which are essential for the `CoordSys3D` object used in the example.
4. **`sympy/vector/deloperator.py`** - This file contains the `Del` operator, which is used in the example and may affect how vector operations are printed.
5. **`sympy/core/expr.py`** - This file handles expressions in SymPy and may influence how expressions are represented and printed.
6. **`sympy/core/symbol.py`** - This file defines symbols, which are fundamental to the expressions being printed.
7. **`sympy/printing/printer.py`** - This file is responsible for the general printing mechanism in SymPy, which could be involved in how the output is formatted.
8. **`sympy/printing/preview.py`** - This file may handle the preview of printed outputs, which could be relevant to the display issue.
9. **`sympy/printing/latex.py`** - While not directly related to terminal output, it may influence how expressions are formatted for different outputs.
10. **`sympy/printing/str.py`** - This file may handle string representations of objects, which could affect how the output is displayed in the terminal.

Based on this reasoning, here are the top-10 most likely culprit files:
