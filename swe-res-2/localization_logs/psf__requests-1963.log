The subsequent 307 should preserve the GET.

2026-01-13 22:36:03,669 - INFO - Based on the bug report, the issue seems to be related to how the `Session.resolve_redirects` method handles HTTP requests, particularly in preserving the method type during redirection. The most relevant files to investigate would be those that are likely to contain the `Session` class and its methods, especially `resolve_redirects`.

Here are the steps to identify the top-10 most likely culprit files:

1. **Identify the main file related to session handling**: The `sessions.py` file is likely to contain the `Session` class and its methods, including `resolve_redirects`.

2. **Look for related files**: Other files that might interact with sessions or handle requests/responses should also be considered. This includes files that define HTTP methods, handle redirects, or manage request objects.

3. **Pre-select files**: Based on the above reasoning, I will pre-select the following files:
   - `requests/sessions.py` (contains the `Session` class)
   - `requests/api.py` (may define API methods that use sessions)
   - `requests/adapters.py` (handles transport and may deal with redirects)
   - `requests/utils.py` (utility functions that may assist in request handling)
   - `requests/exceptions.py` (handles exceptions that may arise during requests)
   - `requests/hooks.py` (may contain hooks that modify request behavior)
   - `requests/status_codes.py` (defines HTTP status codes, relevant for redirects)

4. **Check for additional relevant files**: After considering the above, I will also include:
   - `requests/__init__.py` (initialization file for the requests package)
   - `requests/cookies.py` (if cookies are involved in the session)
   - `requests/auth.py` (if authentication is relevant to the session)

Now, I will compile the final list of the top-10 most likely culprit files based on the reasoning above:

requests/exceptions.py
