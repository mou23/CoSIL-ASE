2026-01-13 22:35:53,995 - INFO - To address the bug report regarding Flask routes and subdomains, we need to focus on files that are likely involved in route handling, blueprint registration, and command-line interface (CLI) functionalities. 

1. **app.py**: This file is likely responsible for the main application logic, including route definitions and blueprint registrations.
2. **blueprints.py**: This file would handle the blueprint functionalities, which are crucial for managing routes associated with subdomains.
3. **cli.py**: This file is responsible for the command-line interface, which includes the `flask routes` command.
4. **views.py**: This file typically contains the view functions that are associated with the routes, including those for the blueprints.
5. **config.py**: This file may contain configuration settings, including server names and subdomain settings.
6. **helpers.py**: This file might contain utility functions that could assist in managing routes or subdomains.
7. **globals.py**: This file may define global variables or functions that could be relevant to the application context, including route handling.

Now, let's confirm the top-10 most likely culprit files based on the reasoning above:
