They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n###\n\n### Candidate Files ###\nrequests/\n    setup.py\n    hooks.py\n    status_codes.py\n    __init__.py\n    exceptions.py\n    utils.py\n    structures.py\n    certs.py\n    api.py\n    sessions.py\n    adapters.py\n    compat.py\n    cookies.py\n    auth.py\n    models.py\n    packages/\n        __init__.py\n        chardet/\n            constants.py\n            euckrprober.py\n            sjisprober.py\n            big5freq.py\n            langhebrewmodel.py\n            __init__.py\n            mbcssm.py\n            chardetect.py\n            charsetgroupprober.py\n            cp949prober.py\n            langgreekmodel.py\n            gb2312prober.py\n            euckrfreq.py\n            euctwprober.py\n            sbcsgroupprober.py\n            mbcharsetprober.py\n            eucjpprober.py\n            universaldetector.py\n            euctwfreq.py\n            escsm.py\n            sbcharsetprober.py\n            latin1prober.py\n            langcyrillicmodel.py\n            hebrewprober.py\n            jpcntx.py\n            langthaimodel.py\n            codingstatemachine.py\n            langhungarianmodel.py\n            escprober.py\n            charsetprober.py\n            gb2312freq.py\n            compat.py\n            utf8prober.py\n            mbcsgroupprober.py\n            big5prober.py\n            langbulgarianmodel.py\n            jisfreq.py\n            chardistribution.py\n        urllib3/\n            response.py\n            poolmanager.py\n            __init__.py\n            exceptions.py\n            connectionpool.py\n            fields.py\n            _collections.py\n            connection.py\n            request.py\n            filepost.py\n            util/\n                response.py\n                url.py\n                ssl_.py\n                __init__.py\n                timeout.py\n                connection.py\n                request.py\n                retry.py\n            packages/\n                __init__.py\n                ordered_dict.py\n                six.py\n                ssl_match_hostname/\n                    __init__.py\n                    _implementation.py\n            contrib/\n                __init__.py\n                ntlmpool.py\n                pyopenssl.py\ndocs/\n    conf.py\n    _themes/\n        flask_theme_support.py\n\n###\n```\n\n\nLet's locate the faulty file step by step using reasoning. \nIn order to locate accurately, you can pre-select 7 files, then check them through function calls, and finally confirm 5 file names.\n\n\nBased on the available information, reconfirm and provide complete name of the top-10 most likely culprit files for the bug. \nSince your answer will be processed automatically, please give your answer in the format as follows.\nThe returned files should be separated by new lines ordered by most to least important and wrapped with ```.\n```\nfile1.py\nfile2.py\nfile3.py\nfile4.py\nfile5.py\nfile6.py\nfile7.py\nfile8.py\nfile9.py\nfile10.py\n```\nReplace the 'file1.py' with the actual file path.\nFor example, \n```\nsklearn/linear_model/__init__.py\nsklearn/base.py\n```\n\n"}]

2026-01-13 22:36:28,999 - INFO - To address the bug report regarding `urllib3` exceptions passing through the `requests` API, we need to focus on files that are likely involved in exception handling and the interaction between `requests` and `urllib3`. 

### Step 1: Pre-selecting Candidate Files
Based on the structure and the context of the bug report, the following files are likely candidates to investigate:

1. `requests/exceptions.py` - This file likely defines the exceptions used by the `requests` library.
2. `requests/api.py` - This file may handle API calls and could be involved in exception management.
3. `requests/sessions.py` - This file manages sessions and may interact with `urllib3`.
4. `requests/adapters.py` - This file is responsible for the transport layer and may handle exceptions from `urllib3`.
5. `requests/packages/urllib3/exceptions.py` - This file defines exceptions specific to `urllib3`.
6. `requests/packages/urllib3/poolmanager.py` - This file manages connection pools and may raise exceptions.
7. `requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py` - This file handles connection pooling and may also raise exceptions.

### Step 2: Function Calls and Exception Handling
Next, we would check the function calls and exception handling in these files to confirm their relevance to the bug. 

### Step 3: Confirming the Top 10 Files
After analyzing the selected files, we can expand our list to include additional relevant files that may also play a role in the exception handling process. 

Here are the top-10 most likely culprit files based on the analysis:
