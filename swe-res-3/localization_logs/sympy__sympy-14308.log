2026-01-14 10:45:24,869 - INFO - Based on the bug report regarding the pretty printing of vectors in the SymPy library, the following files are likely to be involved in the issue:

1. **`sympy/printing/pretty.py`** - This file is likely responsible for the pretty printing functionality, which is directly mentioned in the bug report.
2. **`sympy/printing/printer.py`** - This file may contain the core logic for the printing process, including how expressions are formatted.
3. **`sympy/vector/vector.py`** - Since the issue involves vectors, this file may define how vector objects are represented and printed.
4. **`sympy/vector/coordsysrect.py`** - This file may handle coordinate systems and their representation, which could affect how vectors are printed.
5. **`sympy/printing/latex.py`** - If the pretty printing involves LaTeX formatting, this file could be relevant.
6. **`sympy/printing/preview.py`** - This file might be involved in generating previews of printed expressions, which could relate to the issue.
7. **`sympy/printing/str.py`** - This file may handle string representations of objects, which could impact pretty printing.
8. **`sympy/printing/ccode.py`** - If there are any C code representations involved, this file might also be relevant.
9. **`sympy/printing/rcode.py`** - Similar to `ccode.py`, this file may handle R code representations, which could be related to the printing issue.
10. **`sympy/printing/mathematica.py`** - This file may handle Mathematica representations, which could also be relevant if the pretty printing is expected to support multiple formats.

Based on this reasoning, here are the top-10 most likely culprit files:
