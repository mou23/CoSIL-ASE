2026-01-14 10:23:28,072 - INFO - To address the bug report regarding raising an error when a blueprint name contains a dot, we need to focus on files that are likely related to the handling of blueprints in the Flask application. The most relevant files would typically include those that define or manage blueprints, as well as any related validation or error handling logic.

Based on the provided repository structure, the following files are likely candidates:

1. `src/flask/blueprints.py` - This file is likely responsible for the blueprint functionality, including any validation related to blueprint names.
2. `src/flask/app.py` - This file may handle the application setup and could include logic for registering blueprints.
3. `src/flask/views.py` - This file might contain view functions that could interact with blueprints.
4. `src/flask/helpers.py` - This file may contain utility functions that could be used in conjunction with blueprints.
5. `src/flask/scaffold.py` - This file might be involved in setting up or scaffolding blueprints.
6. `src/flask/config.py` - This file could contain configuration settings that might affect blueprint behavior.
7. `src/flask/signals.py` - This file may handle signals related to application events, including those triggered by blueprints.

Now, let's confirm the top 10 most likely culprit files based on their relevance to the issue described in the bug report:
