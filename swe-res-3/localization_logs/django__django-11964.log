2026-01-14 09:49:18,902 - INFO - To address the bug report, we need to focus on the files that are likely related to the handling of model fields, particularly those dealing with `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices` in Django. The issue seems to stem from how the values of these choices are being retrieved and represented.

1. **models.py**: This file is crucial as it contains the definition of the `MyObject` model and the `CharField` with choices.
2. **fields.py**: This file likely contains the implementation of field types, including how choices are handled in Django models.
3. **enums.py**: This file may define how enumerations (like `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices`) are implemented and how their values are represented.
4. **query.py**: This file may handle queries related to model fields and could be involved in how values are retrieved from the database.
5. **utils.py**: This file might contain utility functions that could affect how values are processed or represented.
6. **validation.py**: This file may include validation logic for model fields, which could be relevant if the type mismatch is being validated.
7. **checks.py**: This file is responsible for system checks and could be involved in identifying issues with model definitions.

Based on this reasoning, the top-10 most likely culprit files are:
