2026-01-14 10:49:23,541 - INFO - Based on the bug report regarding the pretty printing of the `Product` class, the following files are likely to be involved in the formatting and printing of mathematical expressions:

1. **`pretty.py`** - This file is likely responsible for the pretty printing functionality, which is directly mentioned in the bug report.
2. **`printer.py`** - This file may contain the core logic for different types of printers, including pretty printing.
3. **`pretty_symbology.py`** - This file might define the symbols and styles used in pretty printing, which could be relevant to the visual aspects mentioned in the report.
4. **`latex.py`** - Since pretty printing often involves rendering expressions in LaTeX format, this file could be relevant for comparison and adjustments.
5. **`codeprinter.py`** - This file may handle the conversion of expressions to code, which could also affect how they are displayed.
6. **`str.py`** - This file might deal with string representations of expressions, which could impact the output format.
7. **`mathml.py`** - Similar to LaTeX, this file could be involved in rendering expressions in a different format, which might be relevant for comparison.
8. **`tableform.py`** - This file may provide alternative formatting options that could be compared against the current pretty print.
9. **`defaults.py`** - This file might contain default settings for printing, which could influence the output.
10. **`preview.py`** - This file may provide a preview of the printed output, which could be useful for testing changes.

Based on this reasoning, the top-10 most likely culprit files are:
